Working on a course teaching functional javascript

I even though javascript does objects and can be used for objected oriented programming. I think js and web based programming is
better suited to functional programming. This is my endeavor to learn functional programming and hopefully then be able to incorporate
test driven development into it.

Imperative programming describing programs/functions as what they not by how to do them.

1. Immutability
2. Separation of Data and Functions
